### COLISEUM TIME :)
- Upgrade attack to max ex, and like 1-2 levels on the extra
- You need 5000 fans
- 1st do all the tournament, hell rumble, and special event matches with kiryu (if you haven't unlocked try & hit me they are both present in the gambling halls)
- there are special sponsored matches where you have to beat all tier below matches for it to unlock and speak to the specific person, the silver one is in the hall, the other two in the vip room
- you also have to speak to them after that for the gambling matches
- After beating every tournament and hell rumble go to the lobby to trigger the sponsour matchup (talk again after cutscene)
- Then go to boutique and to the gambling hall, talk to the master try and hit me, and on 2nd floor scout twice (for yappikun and chicken man)
- After that go to Fighters Lounge and buy the scrolls etc.
![The clan you want](image-1.png)
- That's the clan you want, you wanna use either Keita or Chicken man as main to utilize boost attack with your heat action + kiryu dies on like 2-3 hits lmao (the chicken man has better attack but way lower defense, It's fine to generally use him but he gets scared every time they use the command and when any of your teammates dies)
- Silver matchups have 4 memebers (Chicken man, Keita, Yappikun, Hirashi)
- Starting platinum 3 you want to start using the machine gun guy
- Buy 8 scrolls (2 Keita, 2 Chicken man, 2 Higashi, 2 Yapikun), buy 4 bonding items and give 2 to Sujiya, 1 to Keita, 1 to chicken man
- Yappi-kun, koji, Sujiya are all there so most of your team doesn't die (Would give all of them one scroll if you struggle later as that's gonna be +10 levels)
- Don't level up the blue guys at all and do platinum tiger festival 1&2 last üëç
- Lines don't really matter just make sure chicken man is somewhere at the back
- When your whole team gets wiped out, quit and go to VIP louge to progress sponsor matchups, go to fighters louge and buy the champagne (1 mil if you don't have bonding maxed out, otherwise the cheapest)
- There is also an option to fight the clown instead at some point to refresh the bad mood
- At some point when visiting the fighter louge buy 2 scrolls and give them to your blue guys you haven't used (hammer guys), as there is no way you gonna get past plat 2 with level 1s

- After finishing the whole coliseum + substories, you'll have to do one akame substory, after that go back to coliseum and do the last 2 matchups as kiryu, then amon hell rumble as usual (do yourself a favor and use Keita and focus Tetsu amon, the golden one)

### Amon
- At this point you should have your attack max out, and all gear slots unlocked, and leveled up your gadgets to max (as that's a substory lmao)
- Have all the bloody items
- Do [this](https://youtu.be/8IIl_eIAw5E?si=gsNXAtJGfqMZ3Txd) :)
- After amon finish the game
