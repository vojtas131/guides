### COLISEUM TIME :)
- You need 5000 fans
- 1st do all the tournament, hell rumble, and special event matches with kiryu (if you haven't unlocked try & hit me they are both present in the gambling halls)
- there are special sponsored matches where you have to beat all tier below matches for it to unlock and speak to the specific person, the silver one is in the hall, the other two in the vip room
- you also have to speak to them after that for the gambling matches
![The clan you want](image-1.png)
- That's the clan you want, you wanna use either Keita or Chicken man as main to utilize boost attack with your heat action + kiryu dies on like 2-3 hits lmao (the chicken man has better attack but way lower defense)
- Silver matchups have 4 memebers (Chicken man, Keita, Yappikun, Hirashi)
- For some of the areas it's better to use kiryu actually, I would say starting platinum 3 you want to start using the machine gun guy
- Buy 8 scrolls (2 Keita, 2 Chicken man, 2 Higashi, 2 Yapikun), buy 2 bonding items and give them to Sujiya
- Also make Higashi level up, you gonna need the heal (+2 scrolls)
- Yappi-kun, koji, Sujiya are all there so most of your team doesn't die (Would give all of them one scroll as that's gonna be +10 levels)
- Don't level up the blue guys at all and do platinum tiger festival 1&2 last üëç
- Lines don't really matter just make sure chicken man is somewhere at the back
- When your whole team gets wiped out, quit and go to VIP louge to progress sponsor matchups, go to fighters louge and buy the champagne (1 mil)
- There is also an option to fight the clown instead at some point to refresh the bad mood, but that's plat 2 strats if you fail
- At some point when visiting the fighter louge buy 2-4 scrolls and give them to your blue guys, as there is no way you gonna get past plat 2 with level 1s

- After finishing the whole coliseum + substories, you'll have to do one akame substory, after that go back to coliseum and do the last 2 matchups as kiryu, then amon hell rumble as usual, and then amon itself

### Amon
- At this point you should have your attack max out, and all gear slots unlocked, and leveled up your gadgets to max (as that's a substory lmao)
- I would also recommend Essense of the Dragon God and Essense of Raging Dragon
- Try to have ex heat in agent and start the juggle, the only way I managed to start it out was when dodging his meelee combo and doing two attacks
- When in juggle try to do yakuza LLLHH DA combo
- The other option is to go nuts with heat attacks, Dragon God, Raging Dragon, Face Stomp
- Very important is to leave Ultimate Essense when he transitions, otherwise you are in a big trouble (Or generally any heat action as you can't use the same twice)
- After amon equip the war god talisman instead of bloody talisman and finish the game
